# Credit Risk Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing credit risk by exploring a dataset containing information on various loan applicants. The primary goal is to build and evaluate predictive models to classify whether a loan applicant will default or not. Given the imbalanced nature of the dataset (more non-defaults than defaults), the project also emphasizes techniques to handle such imbalances, like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).

## Project Structure

The project includes the following files and directories:

- `credit-project.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing all the code and analysis.
- `README.md`: Detailed description of the project.
- `data/`: Directory to store datasets (not included in the repository for privacy reasons).
- `models/`: Directory to save trained models.
- `images/`: Directory to save plots and visualizations.

## Data Overview

The dataset includes various features related to loan applicants, such as income, employment length, and loan status. The target variable is `loan_status`, where `0` indicates non-default (the applicant repaid the loan) and `1` indicates default (the applicant failed to repay the loan).

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Initial data analysis focuses on understanding the distribution of key variables:

- **Distribution of Loan Status**: A pie chart is used to visualize the proportion of defaults vs. non-defaults. The data is heavily imbalanced, with significantly more non-defaults.
- **Box Plots**:
  - `person_income`: To understand the distribution of applicant income.
  - `person_emp_length`: To analyze the length of employment of the applicants.

## Modeling and Evaluation

The project involves training multiple models to predict loan defaults, including:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

### Handling Imbalanced Data

Given the imbalance in the target variable, the project uses the following techniques:

- **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**: To oversample the minority class and balance the dataset.
- **Class Weighting**: Adjusting weights in the loss function to give more importance to the minority class.

A `GridSearchCV` is employed to optimize the `f1` score and find the best parameters for the models.

## ROC Curve Analysis

To evaluate the performance of the models, ROC curves are plotted. The ROC curve provides a visual representation of the trade-off between the true positive rate (recall) and the false positive rate (1 - specificity). The AUC (Area Under the Curve) score is used as a metric to compare models.
